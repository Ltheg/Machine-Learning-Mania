### Defense Wins Championships or Does It? 

In March 2024 Kaggle hodsted a competition to determine the best methods for predicting who would win the NCAA Basketball Tournament, best known as March Madness. As a result I created a tabular model using FastAi and over 20 seasons worth of NCAA regular season and tournament play games as input. Anyone who has spent any meaningful time around basketball or sports in general would be familiar with the phrase "defense wins championships". So I decided to put this theory to the test by weighting my model to favor teams primarily on defensive stats as well as other important factors like field goal percentage and assist to turnover ratio.
